# Human Computer Interaction (HCI @FESB)

This repo serves as an intro to Next.js framework. We hope it can help students following the course on _Human Computer Interaction (HCI)_ at the _University of Split, FESB_, to deepen their understanding of how to build performant web applications and successfully complete their semester project.

**Live version:** https://next-course-app.vercel.app

The repository exemplifies:

-   **Next.js**

    -   File-based static and dynamic client-side routing
    -   Organization of code into modules and components
    -   Image optimization using `next/image` component
    -   Content-mesh principle (i.e., loading data from different sources, local files, Airtable, Contentful)
    -   Static prerendering of blog pages (using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`)
    -   React state hooks (`useState`) to implement a filtering feature

-   **CSS**
    -   Mobile-first approach using a utility-first CSS framework Tailwind
